From the initial meeting, it was clear that the company designed the care package with my Mum's needs and wishes as the primary concern, and we were reassured that my Mum would be well looked after. Based on what we have witnessed over the last 6 months we could not have made a better choice. The management and staff of Home Instead have surpassed our expectations with their care, thoughtfulness, professionalism and empathy. Without exception, the caregivers treated my Mum with genuine warmth and kindness and helped to make the last months of her life happy and contented. I would not hesitate to recommend them and my family and I will always be grateful for the superb support they gave to my Mum and us during a difficult period'.",
