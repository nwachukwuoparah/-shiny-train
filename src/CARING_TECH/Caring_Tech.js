            As we age, falls can become more commonplace or you may notice behaviour which is out of character like leaving the house at unusual hours. During the times our Care Pros may not be there, subtle sensors can make sure your loved one is safe at home and discreet personal alarms link directly to an emergency resolution team in the event of a fall or incident.</p>
